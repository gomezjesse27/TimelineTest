  - It was about four years ago now. I had just come home from college after freshman
    year. My memory of it was hazy. I remember it was just after my grandparents
    had moved out of their old house and into their new one. Well, they moved out
    of that one too, but that's not important. I was there to help everyone unpack
    things. My mom and dad were there too, and so were my aunt, uncle, and cousins.
    My grandma, grandpa, and great-grandma were going to live in that house.%CT1%
  - "My family is pretty conflict heavy. Especially my mother. She, my uncle, and
    my grandparents were all fighting over... something in the kitchen. I can't remember.
    They're all blood related and they argue over the most trivial things. My dad
    and I were just shaking our heads. Same with my aunt. Both my cousins were out
    in the backyard playing at the time. But I was the only one that noticed. \r%CT1%"
  - My great-grandmother wasn't there.%CT1%
  - I told the others about that, but my mom just shoved it aside telling me to go
    check on her. I don't know why, but she paused in that moment, and I could hear
    her footsteps walking behind me. My great-grandmother was old. 92, to be precise.
    I was worried that something was wrong. I approached the door to her room. I
    just felt this... pit in my stomach. But WORSE than anything I ever felt before.%CT1%
  - I knocked on the door, and nobody replied. And that's where things get fuzzy.
    I could hear my mom saying something behind me, but I didn't hear what she said.
    I remember grabbing the doorknob, or was it my mom? Someone grabbed it. I remember
    the air inside hitting my face. It was like it was filled with tiny needles.
    And that's when I saw it.%CT1%
  - I saw my great-grandmother collapsed on the floor in a pool of her own urine.%CT1%
  - Everything stopped in that moment. It felt like time froze. The arguing in the
    kitchen stopped. The moving stopped. My mind. Stopped. Working. It was like I
    was suddenly inside of a giant glacier. People were calling out. They tried to
    get her off the ground. Someone told me to call 911. I remember that was what
    cracked the iceberg for me.%CT1%
  - Have you ever had the sensation of being told to never, ever press a button,
    and then one day someone comes along and tells you that you can finally push
    it? I felt that in the back of my mind. But more than anything I felt panic.%CT1%
  - Everything after that was fragments. The operator responded, and words were still
    abstract to me. I had to ask someone for the address, because it was still new
    at the time. The ambulance responded. A friend of ours who was a EMT was one
    of the first responders.%CT1%
  - But our families were going through some conflicts over... I think it was jobs?
    It doesn't matter anymore. My cousins came in. The older one didn't really understand
    what was going on. She has a mental disorder. A rare one. The younger one was
    crying. She was really close with my great-grandmother. And she was really sensitive
    about these things.%CT1%
  - "My aunt was trying to console them. My uncle and grandparents were in the corner,
    embarrassed and ashamed. Someone had to clean up the mess in her room, I don't
    remember who. My dad drove us home after that.\r%CT1%"
  - Over the next few days, we visited her in the hospital. Her organs were failing.
    We all had to say goodbye to her. A week later, she passed away. It was the first
    time I had lost someone like that. No, that's not true. My paternal grandmother
    passed away before that, but I never knew her that well. And there was this one
    kid in high school I played chess with in chess club. He got into a car crash.
    But neither of those were the same as this.%CT1%
  - 'This was... slow. Painful. Afterwards people kept telling me that if it wasn''t
    for me, they would have just kept arguing in the kitchen and my great-grandmother
    would have just sat in that room for the entire day. I tell everyone now that
    my memory of the events was hazy but...

    %CT1%'
  - From what I remember, I wasn't the one that found her. My mother entered first.
    When I entered, she was already over to my great-grandmother. I wasn't the one
    that found her. I didn't enter that room. I was too scared. I wasn't strong enough.
    If I had, maybe she would have lived longer. If I had noticed sooner, when I
    arrived, maybe she wouldn't have had to go through that. %CT1%
  - "I keep playing those events over and over in my head. Wasn't there anything
    I could have done different? Why did I just stand there in fear? Why couldn't
    I do anything?\r%CT1%"
  - Why?%CT1%
  - ...%CT1%
