  - 'Completion: Thank you for your voluntary participation.'
  - Welcome to the Chromatic Project Extended Testing Program, hereby referred to
    as the CPETP. Pandora Laboratories is not responsible for any and all injuries
    that occur during the CPETP. Your primary objective is to assist Subject 11 in
    completing their primary objective. To assist you with this, you have been given
    access to a small module that will allow you to interact with Subject 11.
  - This module is called the K-177 capsule. You may input basic commands to move
    the modules as well as give orders to Subject 11. Simply use the WASD keys on
    your keypad for movement and left click for interaction with objects.
  - You may also acess the menu by hitting the "Enter" button or E key.  Further
    information as well as a list of commands can be found by looking at the Options
    menu.
  - "If you find Subject 11's primary objective unnecessary to complete, you may
    quit participating in the CPETP at any time. Simply discontinue using the module.
    After an extended period of inactivity, one of our representatives will terminate
    the CPETP.\r"
  - Pandora Laboratories thanks you for your voluntary participation.
