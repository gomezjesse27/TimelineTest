  - dialogueText: Once upon a time, there was a great kingdom. It spanned the horizons
      endlessly. The people of this land were happy and well learned. It seemed that
      this land would be a paradise. But the land was ruled by a corrupt king.

  - dialogueText: This king sought to bring this land of paradise under the rule
      of an invading nation, one that was barbaric and merciless in nature. The king's
      trusted scholar sought to warn the king of these terrifying people, but the
      king was mesmerized by their simplicity. He told the scholar that these people
      were more intelligent and beautiful than appearances would believe, and that
      soon enough he would understand the plan to integrate them into their kingdom.

  - dialogueText: 'When the scholar asked the king what this masterful plan was,
      he refused to answer, and stated that only his son may know the intricacies
      of this plan. The scholar was angered by this, seeing the king as brainwashed
      by the invaders. Many people of the kingdom were torn between the two, and
      soon a civil war broke out between the kingdoms. '

  - dialogueText: 'On one side, the corrupt king and his son, as well as the invaders
      and half of the kingdom. On the other side stood the scholar and his supporters
      of logic and reason. In the end, the scholar was defeated and he as well as
      his scholars were banished to the lowlands of the kingdom and forbidden to
      interact with the king or his subjects, who now resided in the mountains. Such
      it was that the great kingdom was split into two.
